## Withdrawal Notice

I am withdrawing this pull request as it fixes a non-vulnerability.

**Reason for Withdrawal:**
The CORS configuration, while not ideal, is not exploitable due to browser security mechanisms that block wildcard origins with credentials.

**Technical Details:**
- Browser security prevents the described attack
- No real security impact to fix
- Fixing non-vulnerabilities is not valuable

**Conclusion:**
I will focus on finding and fixing real vulnerabilities instead.
