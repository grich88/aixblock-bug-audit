# üö´ VULNERABILITY WITHDRAWAL COMMENTS

## **üìä EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

Based on comprehensive analysis of AIxBlock's rejection patterns and dark web intelligence, we are withdrawing 6 high-risk submissions that are likely to be rejected as "Informational" or "Not a Vulnerability."

**Withdrawal Date**: December 2024
**Reason**: High rejection risk based on AIxBlock's previous responses and browser security

---

## **üî¥ ISSUES TO WITHDRAW**

### **Issue #313: CORS Misconfiguration**
**Withdrawal Reason**: Modern browsers block wildcard + credentials by design
**AIxBlock Pattern**: Matches rejected #311 (identical CORS issue)
**Technical Issue**: Browser security prevents actual exploitation

### **Issue #314: CORS Fix (PR)**
**Withdrawal Reason**: Fixes non-vulnerability
**AIxBlock Pattern**: Fixing something that's not exploitable
**Technical Issue**: No real security impact to fix

### **Issue #316: CORS + Information Disclosure**
**Withdrawal Reason**: Combines two non-exploitable issues
**AIxBlock Pattern**: Browser blocked + public configuration data
**Technical Issue**: No real exploitation path

### **Issue #317: CORS Main Domain**
**Withdrawal Reason**: Identical to #313, browser blocked
**AIxBlock Pattern**: Same as rejected #311
**Technical Issue**: No real exploitation

### **Issue #321: Server Version Disclosure**
**Withdrawal Reason**: No exploitable CVEs found for nginx 1.18.0
**AIxBlock Pattern**: Often considered informational without specific CVEs
**Technical Issue**: No direct security impact demonstrated

### **Issue #322: Missing Security Headers**
**Withdrawal Reason**: No successful attacks demonstrated
**AIxBlock Pattern**: Only vulnerabilities if attacks are demonstrated
**Technical Issue**: No clear exploitation path

## **üìù WITHDRAWAL COMMENT TEMPLATES**

### **Issue #313: CORS Misconfiguration**
```
## Withdrawal Notice

After further analysis and research into AIxBlock's previous responses, I am withdrawing this submission.

**Reason for Withdrawal:**
Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) block cross-origin requests that include credentials when `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` is set to `*`. This is a security feature implemented by design to prevent exactly this type of attack.

**Technical Details:**
- Browser behavior: Credentialed requests with `Origin: *` are blocked by browser security
- No real exploitation: The attack described cannot succeed in modern browsers
- AIxBlock precedent: Issue #311 was rejected for identical reasons

**AIxBlock's Previous Response Pattern:**
"This is not a vulnerability because modern browsers block this combination by design."

**Conclusion:**
While the CORS configuration could be improved for defense-in-depth, it does not represent an exploitable vulnerability due to browser security mechanisms.

I apologize for the submission and will focus on finding real, exploitable vulnerabilities instead.
```

### **Issue #314: CORS Fix (PR)**
```
## Withdrawal Notice

I am withdrawing this pull request as it fixes a non-vulnerability.

**Reason for Withdrawal:**
The CORS configuration, while not ideal, is not exploitable due to browser security mechanisms that block wildcard origins with credentials.

**Technical Details:**
- Browser security prevents the described attack
- No real security impact to fix
- Fixing non-vulnerabilities is not valuable

**Conclusion:**
I will focus on finding and fixing real vulnerabilities instead.
```

### **Issue #316: CORS + Information Disclosure**
```
## Withdrawal Notice

I am withdrawing this submission as it combines two non-exploitable issues.

**Reason for Withdrawal:**
1. CORS part: Browser security blocks wildcard + credentials
2. Information disclosure part: Configuration data considered public by AIxBlock

**Technical Details:**
- Browser behavior prevents CORS exploitation
- Configuration data is non-secret and necessary for frontend operation
- No real exploitation path exists

**AIxBlock Pattern:**
This combines two issues that have been previously rejected individually.

**Conclusion:**
I will focus on finding real vulnerabilities with clear exploitation paths.
```

### **Issue #317: CORS Main Domain**
```
## Withdrawal Notice

I am withdrawing this submission as it's identical to previously rejected issues.

**Reason for Withdrawal:**
This is the same CORS misconfiguration as issue #311, which was rejected.

**Technical Details:**
- Identical to rejected #311
- Browser security prevents exploitation
- No real security impact

**AIxBlock Precedent:**
Issue #311 was rejected for identical reasons.

**Conclusion:**
I will focus on finding new, unique vulnerabilities instead.
```

### **Issue #321: Server Version Disclosure**
```
## Withdrawal Notice

I am withdrawing this submission as it lacks specific exploitable vulnerabilities.

**Reason for Withdrawal:**
No specific CVEs or exploitable vulnerabilities were found for nginx 1.18.0 (Ubuntu).

**Technical Details:**
- Generic server version disclosure
- No specific CVE links provided
- No clear path to exploitation demonstrated

**AIxBlock Pattern:**
Server version disclosure is often considered informational without specific CVEs.

**Conclusion:**
I will research specific CVEs and exploitable vulnerabilities before submitting.
```

### **Issue #322: Missing Security Headers**
```
## Withdrawal Notice

I am withdrawing this submission as no successful attacks were demonstrated.

**Reason for Withdrawal:**
Missing security headers are only vulnerabilities if specific attacks can be demonstrated.

**Technical Details:**
- No XSS attacks demonstrated
- No clickjacking attacks shown
- No content sniffing attacks proven

**AIxBlock Pattern:**
Missing headers are often considered hardening suggestions, not vulnerabilities.

**Conclusion:**
I will demonstrate specific attacks before submitting security header issues.
