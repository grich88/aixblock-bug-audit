## Withdrawal Notice

I am withdrawing this submission as it combines two non-exploitable issues.

**Reason for Withdrawal:**
1. CORS part: Browser security blocks wildcard + credentials
2. Information disclosure part: Configuration data considered public by AIxBlock

**Technical Details:**
- Browser behavior prevents CORS exploitation
- Configuration data is non-secret and necessary for frontend operation
- No real exploitation path exists

**AIxBlock Pattern:**
This combines two issues that have been previously rejected individually.

**Conclusion:**
I will focus on finding real vulnerabilities with clear exploitation paths.
