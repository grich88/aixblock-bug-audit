## Withdrawal Notice

After further analysis and research into AIxBlock's previous responses, I am withdrawing this submission.

**Reason for Withdrawal:**
Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) block cross-origin requests that include credentials when `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` is set to `*`. This is a security feature implemented by design to prevent exactly this type of attack.

**Technical Details:**
- Browser behavior: Credentialed requests with `Origin: *` are blocked by browser security
- No real exploitation: The attack described cannot succeed in modern browsers
- AIxBlock precedent: Issue #311 was rejected for identical reasons

**AIxBlock's Previous Response Pattern:**
"This is not a vulnerability because modern browsers block this combination by design."

**Conclusion:**
While the CORS configuration could be improved for defense-in-depth, it does not represent an exploitable vulnerability due to browser security mechanisms.

I apologize for the submission and will focus on finding real, exploitable vulnerabilities instead.
