## Withdrawal Notice

I am withdrawing this submission as it's identical to previously rejected issues.

**Reason for Withdrawal:**
This is the same CORS misconfiguration as issue #311, which was rejected.

**Technical Details:**
- Identical to rejected #311
- Browser security prevents exploitation
- No real security impact

**AIxBlock Precedent:**
Issue #311 was rejected for identical reasons.

**Conclusion:**
I will focus on finding new, unique vulnerabilities instead.
